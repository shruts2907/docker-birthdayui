output in a web browser and should generate no errors. Feel free to
utilize various JS libraries and utilities to complete the task.


Requirements

Make a call to the randomuser.me API (or next.json-generator if
randomuser.me is offline) and get 100 users.
Display the following fields for each user:

First name
Last name
Country

dynamically calculated.

The value should identify if the user’s birthday: a) already happened,
